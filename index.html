  <h3>Wins:</h3>

  <h3>Number of guesses remaining:</h3>

  <h3>Letters Already Guessed</h3>

  <!-- I need to pick a random word - function from array
  I need the random word to be displayed as blank spaces
  I need the user to select a letter by typing key - keystroke listener
  If the letter is in the random word, it needs to populate the corresponding blank space, if not the letter should go into the "already guessed" section
  Each time a letter is chosen, the number of guesses needs to decrease by 1
  When the user win/loses, the program should start again with a new word - for-loop?  -->

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Establishes words and random selection
    const sample = ["SAMPLE", "HODGE", "STING", "CHAMPION", "STRATOCASTER"];

    let word = sample[Math.floor(Math.random()*sample.length)];

    let answer = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        answer[i] = "_ ";
        document.querySelector("#game-space").innerHTML = answer;
      }      
    
      let remainingLetters = word.length;
